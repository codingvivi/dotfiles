;; --- For Reloading Config ---
;; If you reload your Hammerspoon config, you might want to stop the watcher
;; to avoid multiple watchers or orphaned hotkeys. The init function already
;; handles stopping an existing watcher if `app-watcher` is not nil.
;; You can also add a more explicit cleanup if needed, e.g. in a separate function
;; that you would call before hs.reload().

 (set app-specific-hotkeys [])

;; -- To test --
;; 1. Save this as part of your init.fnl or a separate file you `require`.
;; 2. Change `target-bundle-id` to an app you use (e.g., "com.apple.TextEdit").
;; 3. Reload Hammerspoon config.
;; 4. Switch to the target app. Try Cmd+Shift+H and Ctrl+Opt+P.
;; 5. Switch to another app. Try the hotkeys â€“ they should do nothing.
;; 6. Check Hammerspoon console for INFO messages.
